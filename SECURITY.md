# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, 2.0 and 2.1 are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email <maintainers>.

If you have a patch for the vulnerability, please include it.

If the maintainers determine that the issue is sensitive, it will be handled
confidentially in accordance with this process. If the issue is not considered
sensitive, development of a patch will occur via the regular process on the
mailing list.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published by email to the Patchwork mailing list.

Some Patchwork instance operators and downstream packagers may be notified in
advance of advisories, under embargo, to allow patching of instances. If you
fall into this category and wish to be included, please email the maintainers,
and give your contact details, details of the *public-facing* Patchwork instance
you operate or the downstream package you maintain, and a statement confirming
that you will strictly abide by the terms of any embargo set by the
maintainers. Inclusion on this list is at maintainer discretion.
