## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email <maintainers>.

If you have a patch for the vulnerability, please include it.

If the maintainers determine that the issue is sensitive, it will be handled in accordance with this process. If the issue is not considered sensitive, development of a patch will occur via the regular process on the mailing list.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published by email to the Patchwork mailing list.

Some Patchwork instance operators and downstream packagers may be notified in advance of advisories, under embargo, to allow patching of instances. If you fall into this category and wish to be included, please email <maintainer>, and give your contact details, details of the *public-facing* Patchwork instance you operate or the downstream package you maintain, and a statement confirming that you will strictly abide by the terms of any embargo set by the maintainers. Inclusion on this list is at maintainer discretion.
